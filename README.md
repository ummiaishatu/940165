The task:For this task, you will be undertaking a small bit of evaluative research into the task of object detection. You are provided with a subset of the CIFAR10 dataset, a small image dataset with 10 different categories of objects. The dataset has been divided into training and testing sets and you will apply machine learning algorithms taught on the course to classify the object in an image. 

 

You are required to write a 4-page report to summarize your proposed method and the results. Your report should contain the following sections:

- Introduction. Provide overview of the problem, the proposed solution, and your experimental results.
- Method. Present your proposed method in detail. This should cover how the features are extracted, any feature processing you use (e.g. clustering and histogram generation, dimensionality reduction), which classifier(s) is/are used, and how they are trained and tested. This section may contain multiple sub-sections.
- Results. Present your experimental results in thissection. Explain the evaluation metric(s) you use and present the quantitative results (including the confusion matrix).
- Conclusion. Provide a summary for your method and the results. Provide your critical analysis; including shortcomings of the methods and how they may be improved.
- References. Include correctly formatted references where appropriate. References are not included in the page limit.
